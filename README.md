# PythonChallenges
A series of python challenges we will work through over the remainder of the course to keep us sane while we are doing the theory for the exam.

If you feel like you want to consolidate the basics choose exercises from [Practice Python](https://www.practicepython.org)

If you are feeling more confident, try exercises from the following list:
* [Python conditional statements and loops](https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/python-conditional-statements-and-loop-exercises.php)
* [Python functions](https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/python-functions-exercises.php)
* [Python class](https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/class-exercises/index.php)

As you complete a task, add your solution to this repository as a python file and add the task and date to the table below. One of your challenges is to add tasks to the table using markdown. Use this [markdown-cheetsheet](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf)

Date | Task
